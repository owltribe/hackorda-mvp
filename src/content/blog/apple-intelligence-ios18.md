At its recent Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple unveiled "Apple Intelligence," its suite of AI features integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.

Rather than focusing on a single chatbot, Apple Intelligence aims to provide practical, context-aware assistance across the operating system. Key features include enhanced writing tools (rewriting, proofreading, summarizing text in Mail, Notes, Pages, etc.), new image generation capabilities ("Image Playground") for creating playful images in Messages and other apps, and significantly smarter Siri interactions.

Siri benefits from a better understanding of natural language, on-screen context awareness, and the ability to take actions within and across apps. Apple emphasized a strong focus on privacy, with most AI processing happening on-device. For more complex requests requiring larger models, Apple introduced "Private Cloud Compute," designed to process data on secure Apple silicon servers without storing user information.

Furthermore, Apple announced an integration partnership with OpenAI, allowing users to optionally leverage ChatGPT's capabilities (initially GPT-4o) directly within Siri and system-wide Writing Tools when more advanced world knowledge or creative assistance is needed, with user permission requested before sending data to OpenAI servers. This marks a significant step for Apple in bringing generative AI features to its vast user base. 

A new category of personal computers, dubbed "AI PCs" or Microsoft's branding "Copilot+ PCs," is emerging, promising enhanced performance and capabilities specifically for artificial intelligence tasks.

These machines are characterized by the inclusion of dedicated Neural Processing Units (NPUs) alongside traditional CPUs and GPUs. NPUs are optimized for efficiently handling the mathematical operations common in AI workloads, such as running local language models or processing real-time image and audio data.

Microsoft's Copilot+ PC initiative sets specific hardware requirements, including powerful NPUs capable of over 40 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), ample RAM (16GB minimum), and fast SSD storage (256GB minimum). These specifications enable new Windows features like Recall (which locally records and analyzes user activity for easy retrieval), live captions with translation, and enhanced creative tools that leverage local AI processing.

Major manufacturers like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and Microsoft itself (with its Surface line) are launching Copilot+ PCs featuring processors from Qualcomm (Snapdragon X Elite/Plus) initially, with Intel and AMD expected to follow suit. This shift signifies a move towards more distributed AI processing, where tasks can be handled locally on the device for improved speed, privacy, and offline capability, rather than relying solely on cloud-based services.
