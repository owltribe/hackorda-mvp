A new category of personal computers, dubbed "AI PCs" or Microsoft's branding "Copilot+ PCs," is emerging, promising enhanced performance and capabilities specifically for artificial intelligence tasks.

These machines are characterized by the inclusion of dedicated Neural Processing Units (NPUs) alongside traditional CPUs and GPUs. NPUs are optimized for efficiently handling the mathematical operations common in AI workloads, such as running local language models or processing real-time image and audio data.

Microsoft's Copilot+ PC initiative sets specific hardware requirements, including powerful NPUs capable of over 40 TOPS (trillions of operations per second), ample RAM (16GB minimum), and fast SSD storage (256GB minimum). These specifications enable new Windows features like Recall (which locally records and analyzes user activity for easy retrieval), live captions with translation, and enhanced creative tools that leverage local AI processing.

Major manufacturers like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, and Microsoft itself (with its Surface line) are launching Copilot+ PCs featuring processors from Qualcomm (Snapdragon X Elite/Plus) initially, with Intel and AMD expected to follow suit. This shift signifies a move towards more distributed AI processing, where tasks can be handled locally on the device for improved speed, privacy, and offline capability, rather than relying solely on cloud-based services.
