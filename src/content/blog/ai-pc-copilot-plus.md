A new category of personal computers, officially branded by Microsoft as "Copilot+ PCs," is emerging. These devices represent a significant shift, integrating powerful hardware specifically designed to accelerate local artificial intelligence tasks directly on the machine.

The defining characteristic of a Copilot+ PC is the inclusion of a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) alongside the traditional CPU and GPU. NPUs are specialized processors optimized for the high-speed mathematical operations required by AI workloads, such as running local large language models (LLMs), real-time translation, or advanced image/audio processing, without heavily relying on the cloud.

Microsoft has set specific minimum hardware requirements for the Copilot+ PC designation:

*   **NPU Performance:** Capable of over 40 TOPS (trillions of operations per second).
*   **RAM:** 16GB minimum.
*   **Storage:** 256GB SSD minimum.

These specifications enable new and enhanced Windows features, including:

*   **Recall:** Locally records and analyzes user activity, creating a searchable visual timeline of virtually everything done on the PC (with privacy controls).
*   **Live Captions:** Real-time captions and translation for any audio source.
*   **Enhanced Creative Tools:** AI-powered features in apps like Paint (Cocreator) and Photos.
*   **Windows Studio Effects:** Improved background blur, eye contact correction, and voice focus for video calls.

Major PC manufacturers like Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Acer, ASUS, and Microsoft itself (with new Surface devices) launched the first wave of Copilot+ PCs starting in June 2024. Initially, these feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and Snapdragon X Plus processors, built on the Arm architecture. Intel (Lunar Lake) and AMD (Strix Point) processors meeting the Copilot+ requirements are expected later in 2024. This signifies a major industry move towards more capable, efficient, and privacy-focused on-device AI processing.
